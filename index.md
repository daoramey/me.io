I'm a **researcher** passionate about decoding **non-verbal communication** and enhancing **remote interaction experiences**. My work focuses on developing innovative prototypes that capture and analyze non-verbal social cues, while exploring the dynamics of interpersonal synchrony in both physical and virtual environments. When I'm not immersed in research, you can find me staying active on the tennis court or exploring scenic hiking trails.
