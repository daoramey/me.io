### 🕶️ **Social Interaction with Virtual Agent**
📂 **GitHub Repo**: View Code  
📄 **Research Paper**: Read Here  
🚀 **Description**:
Developed a full-body photorealistic agent avatar for social VR & human-agent interaction. The avatar includes facial expressions, eye gaze tracking, blinking, and body gestures to enhance interaction realism. Integrated into an interactive VR environment where the agent adapts based on user behavior.  
🛠 **Technologies**:
Unity for VR environment and avatar rendering
Unreal Engine (MetaHuman) for photorealistic avatar creation
OpenFace & MediaPipe for real-time facial expression & eye gaze tracking
VRChat SDK / OpenXR for VR interaction
Machine Learning for behavior adaptation
