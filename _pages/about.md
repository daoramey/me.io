title: About Me
---

Hello, I'm **Chenyao Diao**, a research engineer dedicated to harnessing advanced technologies to capture and interpret human behavior. With over 3 years of experience as a research assistant in telepresence system development, I specialize in using deep learning and computer vision to explore the subtle dynamics of non-verbal communication. My work bridges the gap between technology and human interaction—designing studies and prototypes that measure interpersonal behavioral synchrony and coordination.

## 🔎 Research & Interaction Analysis

- **Immersive Communication Systems:**  
  I design and develop telepresence and immersive platforms to enhance human-avatar interactions in social VR/AR and videoconferencing settings.

- **Quality of Experience Assessment:**  
  I design and conduct user studies that compare non-verbal behaviors under varied experimental conditions, shedding light on how system design influences natural communication.

- **Multi-Modal Data Acquisition:**  
  I build multi-camera and sensor-based recording systems to capture real-world interactions, establishing a robust foundation for analyzing both behavioral and physiological activities.

- **Non-Verbal Communication Analysis:**  
  I create prototypes that extract and analyze a wide array of non-verbal cues—including facial expressions, eye gaze, head and body movements, blink rate, speech activity, turn-taking, interpersonal synchrony, and smile mimicry—to better understand communication dynamics.
